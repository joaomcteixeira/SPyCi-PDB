# Summary

Structural determination of proteins have been a central scientific focus since the early 1960s [@Dill2008]
with technological advances facilitating experimental structures of stable, folded proteins by nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [@Kanelis2001], X-ray crystallography [@Smyth2000], and cryo-electron microscopy [@Malhotra2019],
as well as the recent computational prediction of structures [@Jumper2021; @Baek2021]. Modeling intrinsically
disordered proteins and disordered regions (IDPs/IDRs), however, remain challenging due to their highly dynamic nature
and low-propensity to form low energy folded structures [@Mittag2007].

Currently, approaches to model IDPs/IDRs generally start with initial pools of structures sampling potentially accessible
conformations and then utilize experimental data to narrow the pool. One method to generate initial conformational ensembles
of IDPs/IDRs uses sampling techniques such as in TraDES [@Feldman2000; @Feldman2001], Flexible-meccano [@Ozenne2012],
FastFloppyTail [@Ferrie2020], IDPConformerGenerator [@Teixeira2022], and others [@Estaa2019] that rely on the torsion
angle distributions found in high-resolution folded protein structures deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank [@Berman2000].
Another more computationally expensive approach generates conformational ensembles using Molecular Dynamics (MD)
simulations with different force-fields [@Salvi2016; @Robustelli2018].

After generating the initial pool of structures, back-calculations to experimental data and reweighting using
Monte-Carlo [@Krzeminski2012] or Bayesian statistics [@Lincoff2020; @Bottaro2020] can be performed to define structural
ensembles that better match solution NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), single molecule fluorescence (SMF), and
other experimentally obtained data from these IDPs/IDRs. An emerging method to generate conformations of IDPs/IDRs uses
machine learning generative models based on ensembles generated from sampling or MD techniques as training data and
reinforces learning with experimental data [@Zhang2022]. Both of these general approaches rely on back-calculation of "experimental
observables" from coordinates of conformers within the ensembles, a task that is increasingly complex due to the various
models for interpretation of experimental data and the numerous tools available.

Here we present **SPyCi-PDB**, designed to facilitate and streamline this back-calculation stage by acting as a
platform for internal back-calculator functions as well as published third-party software, utilizing PDB structures
of disordered protein conformations. One goal of **SPyCi-PDB** is to minimize the existing issues with different
data-formats from software and scripts within the IDP/IDR research community and improve accessibility to
non-computational researchers. In this release, **SPyCi-PDB** can back-calculate NMR chemical shifts (`cs`),
paramagnetic resonance enhancement (`pre`), nuclear Overhauser effect (`noe`), 3J-HNHA coupling (`jc`), and residual
dipolar coupling (`rdc`) data; hydrodynamic radius (`rh`) data from NMR, light scattering or size exclusion chromatography;
SAXS (`saxs`); and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (`smfret`) values from all-atom PDB structures of
IDP/IDR conformations.

# Statement of Need

As new software packages and *in silico* methodologies emerge to better model IDP/IDR structures,
back-calculations to multiple experimental datatypes are required to quantitatively assess the conformers generated.
The current state of back-calculating PRE and NOE distances for dynamic protein systems, are not robust as the correlation
of two interacting groups of protons, in the case of NOEs, cannot be described by a simple distance. Furthermore, the data
from PRE back-calculations are improperly used in IDPs as a wider range of distances are sampled for disordered compared
to folded proteins. Although advancements in back-calculation of chemical shifts has been made, as seen in UCBShift [@Li2020],
improvements can still be made as the error in some cases is larger than the deviation of the back-calculated values. Given
the rapid developing nature of different software tools to perform back-calculations, **SPyCi-PDB** should assist by providing
a user-friendly, all-in-one package to reduce time and confusion in this back-calculation step as well as
open opportunities for future collaborations and integration of new experimental datatypes. Furthermore,
**SPyCi-PDB** aims to unify different input and output data formats from different experimental datatypes
to increase productivity and accelerate research. As stated in the documentation hosted by ReadTheDocs,
input formats are conventional comma-delimited tables (e.g. `.CSV, .TXT`), while the output format is human-readable `.JSON` files that
can be easily manipulated using Python or other software based on the user's ultimate needs. **SPyCi-PDB**
was also developed to integrate into the IDPConformerGenerator platform.

Ultimately, given the complicated and dynamic exchanging nature of IDPs, back-calculators will still need to be developed
with these features in mind. By creating a tool with modularity and best practices, we aim to encourage other
researchers to contribute towards this platform to further the goal of improved modelling of IDPs and IDRs.

# Implementation

As of the current release of version 0.1.X, four out of eight modules of  **SPyCi-PDB**'s back-calculators
(`pre`, `noe`, `jc`, `smfret`) use internal mathematical algorithms and PDB structure processing using
IDPConformerGenerator libraries [@Teixeira2022]. The `pre` (1) and `noe` (2) module calculates scalar distances
between pairs of atoms according to the pairs derived from the experimental template. It utilizes an algorithm
that matches atom names of each residue with allowance for multiple assignments for `noe`. The `jc` (3) module uses
the Karplus curve, a simple cosine function, to back-calculate the desired J-couplings according to residue
number as provided by the experimental template file [@Perez2001]. Finally, the `smfret` (4) module takes into
consideration residue pairs and a scale factor to adjust for dye size from the experimental setup to back-calculate
distances between two CA atoms. The equations mentioned above are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1)\ \sqrt{\delta x^2 + \delta y^2 + \delta z^2}\\\\
(2)\ \sqrt[6]{(\frac{(\delta x^2 + \delta y^2 + \delta z^2)^3}{N}}\\\\
(3)\ \cos(\varphi - \frac{10800^{\circ}}{\pi})\\\\
(4)\ \frac{1.0}{1.0 + (\frac{D \cdot \sqrt{\frac{|R_1 - R_2|+7}{R_1 - R_2}}}{S})^6}
\end{aligned}
$$

The remaining 4 modules (`cs`, `saxs`, `rh`, `rdc`) call upon third-party academic software: UCBShift for
chemical shifts [@Li2020], CRYSOL v3 for SAXS [@Franke2017], HullRad for Rh [@Fleming2018], and PALES for RDC [@Zweckstetter2000]. Thorough testing of each module has been performed to ensure smooth installation and troubleshooting as well as retaining or providing multiprocessing capabilities that may not have been implemented in their standalone form. When choosing third-party software, we prioritized recent published endeavors written in Python for ease of integration such as UCBShift, and HullRad.

We are also open to integrate other options for back-calculators such as DEER-PREdict [@Tesei2021] for PREs, and alternative
methods to calculating experimental datatypes internally such as using a parameterizable fluoresence liftime and the FÃ¶rster
distance as used in the Naudi-Fabra et al. study of describing intrinsically disordered proteins using
smFRET, NMR, and SAXS [@Naudi-Fabra2021]. Future additions to the **SPyCi-PDB** interface suite are welcome and easy to perform given its design with modularity in mind.

# Installation

To install **spycipdb**, follow the instructions provided on the corresponding documentation
web page or `docs/installation.rst` in the repository. As **spycipdb** is written completely in Python,
it is compatible with any platform able to execute Python (>=3.8 but <4.0). However, certain third-party
extensions to perform back-calculations (SAXS and RDC) have only been tested on 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04.X LTS
and 20.04.X LTS, as well as WSL 2.0 on 64-bit Windows 11. It is recommended that users read the detailed
installation and troubleshooting documentation before using Anaconda or virtualenv to install and configure **spycipdb**.

# Example Usage

The current version of **spycipdb** has eight command-line modules that execute different
back-calculation routines for PDB formatted protein structure files. Usage examples, along
with input/output formats are provided both in the project's documentation hosted on ReadTheDocs and by the command:

```bash
$ spycipdb -h
```

To provide an example, we showcase the built-in PRE module with `pre` used to back-calculate
PRE distances given an experimental data template:

```bash
$ spycipdb pre /path/pdbs/ -e pdbs_PRE.txt -n 16 -o bc_pdbs_PRE.json
```

Users can specify a directory or tarball (.TAR) with `N` number of PDB files and an experimental template file
`--exp-file`,`-e`, along with how many cores/workers to use `--ncores`,`-n` and the output file `--output`,`-o`.
