What is PALES?
=============

PALES is a software for analysis of residual dipolar couplings.
Its main component is the PALES (Prediction of ALignmEnt from Structure)
simulation that predicts the magnitude and orientation of a sterically 
induced alignment tensor from a solute's (protein/nucleic acid/oligosaccharide)
three-dimensional shape. This can be used to validate the correctness of 
derived structures, to distinguish monomeric from multimeric structures and 
to evaluate multiple-conformer models for flexible proteins. In addition, 
features for analysis of experimental dipolar couplings and dipolar coupling 
tensors are available, such as best-fitting a dipolar coupling tensor to its 
corresponding 3D structure. 



Components of the PALES Software
================================

The PALES software consists of five modules:

* prediction of molecular alignment/residual dipolar couplings from first 
  principles (PALES; standard PDB format)
* PALES for free format 3D structures
* best-fit of measured dipolar couplings to 3D structure
* basic analysis of dipolar coupling tensors
* basic analysis of dipolar couplings

These components allow a rapid analysis of weak alignment that can be observed 
when a macromolecule is dissolved in a dilute liquid crystalline phase 
(N. Tjandra & A. Bax, Science, 278, (1997) 1111-1114). The components comprise 
the following:


1. Prediction of molecular alignment/residual dipolar couplings from first 
   principles (PALES) 

   This module comprises the prediction of alignment from structure approach as 
   previously distributed under the name SSIA. PALES predicts the magnitude and 
   orientation of a solute's alignment from its three-dimensional shape. This 
   can be used to validate the correctness of derived structures, to distinguish 
   monomeric from multimeric structures and to evaluate multiple-conformer 
   models for flexible proteins. The only required input is a PDB structure. 
   Using the PDB structure the alignment tensor will be simulated assuming 
   purely steric interaction between the molecule of interest and the liquid 
   crystal particles. From the alignment tensor dipolar couplings can then be 
   predicted. Liquid crystal systems having a dominant steric interaction 
   include bicelles (M. Ottiger & A. Bax, 12, (1998), 361-372) and 
   poly(ethylene glycol)-based systems (M. Rueckert & G. Otting, J. Am. Chem. 
   Soc., 122, (2000), 7793-7797). In cases where electrostatic repulsion plays 
   a major role the orientation of a solute's alignment can also reliably be 
   predicted.

2. PALES for free format 3D structures

   With this module a PALES simulation based on first principles can be 
   performed for any array of three-dimensional coordinates. No standard 
   PDB format is required. Simulation parameters are accessible in the same 
   way as in 1).

3. Best-fit of measured dipolar couplings to 3D structure

   The alignment tensor predicted based solely on the three-dimensional
   structure of a molecule can be compared to one back-calculated from a set of 
   measured residual dipolar couplings. For such a best-fit of observed dipolar 
   couplings to a 3D structure singular value decomposition and powell
   minimization are available. The order matrix analysis of residual dipolar 
   couplings via singular value decomposition is performed as described by J.A. 
   Losonczi, M. Andrec, M.W.F. Fischer and J.H. Prestegard, J. Magn. Reson., 
   138, (1999) 334-342. Singular value decomposition only needs a minimum of 5 
   dipolar couplings, whereas powell minimization allows fixing of any of the 
   five parameters describing the alignment tensor during minimization. In 
   addition, this module offers the possibility to predict residual dipolar 
   couplings from a user supplied alignment tensor. The required input is a PDB 
   file and a minimum of five dipolar couplings.

4. Basic analysis of dipolar coupling tensors

   This module allows manipulation of dipolar coupling tensors. Simple
   mathematical operations are possible for two dipolar coupling tensors
   such as addition or multiplication. In addition, back-calculation of Euler 
   angles from an arbitrary symmetric and traceless matrix is possible as well 
   as comparison of two alignment tensors in three and five dimensions. The 
   minimum required input is a matrix with five independent elements.

5. Basic analysis of dipolar couplings

   This module allows manipulation of two sets of dipolar couplings. Simple 
   mathematical operations are possible for sets of dipolar couplings such as 
   addition or multiplication. In addition, two sets of dipolar couplings can 
   be compared statistically. The required input is at least one table with 
   dipolar couplings.



Changes to SSIA
===============

Besides the new name there are several changes compared to the original
SSIA version of the program.

1. PALES is now fully usable for proteins, nucleic acids and oligosaccharides.
2. Any type of dipolar coupling can be used.
3. Parameters for a PALES simulation are controlled by command line arguments.
4. All standard PDB files can be used including multiple-chain molecules. A 
   broad range of functions (written by Frank Delaglio) for selecting certain 
   parts of a molecule were incorporated. In addition, a separate module is 
   available for performing a PALES simulation on non-standard PDB files.
5. The input and output format has been unified with the DC program by Frank 
   Delaglio.
6. PALES and DC use now the same internuclear distances for the N-HN, CA-HA,
   CA-C and N-C vectors (M. Ottiger & A. Bax, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 120, (1998)
   12334-12341).
7. All observed dipolar couplings are now supplied as isotropic - aligned
   splitting. The negative gyromagnetic ratio of 15N is taken into account 
   within PALES.
8. Additional features for analysis of experimental dipolar couplings and 
   dipolar coupling tensors were included.



How to Use PALES
================

Various options are available for the different PALES modules. To start off 
type

   pales -help

This gives you the list of available command line arguments shown in the 
appendix. The basic use of the currently five available modules is as follows:

 
1. Prediction of molecular alignment/residual dipolar couplings from first 
principles (PALES)

   module flag:	-stPales	[default]

   * Basic simulation of magnitude and orientation of a solute's alignment
     (SSIA mode 1)

     pales -pdb 1IGD_H_sDC.pdb

     (Default simulation parameters are used and results are written to standard 
     output; the magnitude of alignment scales linearly with concentration and 
     for molecules with dimensions of roughly the rod radius alignment tensors 
     for the wall and the rod model are collinear.)

   * Simulation of alignment tensor and prediction of dipolar couplings 
     (SSIA mode 2)

     pales -inD dc_1IGD.tab -pdb 1IGD_H_s.pdb -outD ssiaB.tbl \
        -s1 2 -a1 7 -pdbRot rot.pdb

     ('-s1' and '-a1' are used for specifying an offset of 5 between the PDB 
      file and the sequence number of the measured residual dipolar couplings;
      with '-pdbRot' a PDB file is written out that is rotated in such a way 
      that the axes of the alignment tensor are parallel to the laboratory 
      frame.)

   * As above but specifying various simulation parameters

     pales -inD dc_1IGD.tab -pdb 1IGD_H_s.pdb -outD ssiaC.tbl \
        -s1 2 -a1 7 -r1 10 -rN 60 \
        -bic -wv 0.03 -dGrid 0.3 -dot 133 -digPsi 23 -rM 33.0 \
        -lcS 0.83 -rA 0.3 -H -nosurf

    (For details on command line arguments see below; '-r1' and '-rN' are used 
     for selection of residues 10 to 60 in the simulation.)


2. PALES for free format 3D structures

   * Basic simulation of magnitude and orientation of a solute's alignment

     pales -stPalesFree -pdbF 1IGD_H_s.pdb -outA ssiaF.tbl

   * As above but specifying various simulation parameters

     pales -stPalesFree -pdbF 1IGD_H_s.pdb -outA ssiaF.tbl \
        -bic -wv 0.03 -dGrid 0.3 -dot 133 -digPsi 23 -rM 33.0 \
        -lcS 0.83 -rA 0.3 -H -nosurf


3. Best-fit of measured dipolar couplings to 3D structure

   module flag:	-bestFit

   * Singular value decomposition

     pales -bestFit -inD dc_1IGD.tab -pdb 1IGD_H_s.pdb \
        -outD svd.tbl -s1 2 -a1 7 -pdbRot rot.pdb   \
        -map 500 -outMap worldmap.txt

     (The '-map' flag is used for mapping the deviation of alignment tensor 
      orientations. These are written to 'worldmap.txt'. 500 iterations are 
      done.)

   * Back-calculation of dipolar couplings from a user supplied order matrix

     pales -bestFit -inD dc_1IGD.tab -pdb 1IGD_H_s.pdb \
        -outD saupePred.tbl -s1 2 -a1 7 \
        -saupe -9.2042e-05  2.3990e-04  3.8255e-04 -4.4549e-04  3.9788e-04

     (The order of matrix elements is Szz, Sxx-yy, Sxy, Sxz and Syz.)

   * Back-calculation of residual dipolar couplings for Fixed Da, Dr, and 
     Rotations

     pales -bestFit -inD dc_1IGD.tab -pdb 1IGD_H_s.pdb \
        -outD dadrFixed.tbl -s1 2 -a1 7 \
        -fixed -da -4.135779e-04 -dr -6.901196e-05  \
        -psi -43.23 -theta 149.43 -phi 81.40

   * Powell minimization for best alignment orientation with fixed Da & Dr

Data Format
===========

1. Input

   * PDB file

     All standard PDB files can be used (including MOLMOL files).

     IMPORTANT: All atoms in the PDB file will be used including pseudo atoms 
                (ANI), if no appropriate selection command line arguments are 
                specified.


   * Dipolar coupling input

     1. The protein sequence should be given as shown by one or more 
        "DATA SEQUENCE" lines. Space characters in the sequence will be 
        ignored. 

     2. The table must include columns for residue ID, three-character residue 
        name and the atom name for both atoms that are involved in the dipolar 
        coupling as well as the dipolar coupling itself, its error and a 
        weighting factor. The atom notation should be consistent with that 
        given in the PDB file.

     3. The table must include a "VARS" line that labels the corresponding 
        columns of the table.

     4. The table must include a "FORMAT" line that defines the data type of 
        the corresponding columns of the table.

     5. Lines with a '#' sign as first character as well as empty lines are 
        ignored.

2. Output

If no output files are specified results are written to standard output.

Following parameters/values are reported:

* Simulation parameters used.
* Order matrix, its irreducible representation and the corresponding norm.
* Eigensystem from diagonalization.
* Euler angles for clockwise rotation about z, y', z''.
* Euler angles for rotation about three independent axes.
* Magnitude of alignment in a three-dimensional representation as given by 
  Da=1/2Szz and Dr=1/3(Sxx-Syy) (G. M. Clore, A. M. Gronenborn & A. Bax, 
  J. Magn. Reson., 133, (1997) 216-221).
* Statistics of observed and predicted dipolar couplings.
* Input dipolar couplings, predicted dipolar couplings and their difference 
  in the same format as the input dipolar coupling table (see above). The 
  columns with the predicted dipolar couplings and the difference follow that 
  of the observed ones (see below).

To assess a prediction look at the following parameters:

* Magnitude of alignment
  The degree of alignment can be judged from the norm of the irreducible 
  representation or from the magnitude of the largest eigenvalue Szz of the 
  order matrix. Using the latter, however, can be misleading in the case of 
  high rhombicity. (To get the magnitude of alignment in Hz multiply Da by the 
  dipolar interaction value given in the output table.)

* Orientation of alignment
  The orientation of a dipolar coupling tensor is described by three Euler 
  angles. Euler angles for clockwise rotation about z, y', z'' are defined as:
     alpha:	Clockwise rotation around z, leading to new system x',y',z'
     beta:	Clockwise rotation around y', leading to new system x'',y'',z''
     gamma:	Clockwise rotation around z''

  with the limits: 0 <= alpha < 360, 0 <= beta < 180, 0 <= gamma < 360. Four 
  equivalent Euler orientations are reported due to the sign ambiguity of 
  eigenvectors. 

* Statistics
  Statistics were computed according to methods given in:
     W.H. Press, S.A. Teukolsky, B.P. Flannery and W.T. Vetterling: Numerical
     Recipies in C Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1988

Implementation 
==============

PALES is written in the C programming language. 



Timing 
======

On an SGI R10000 OCTANE workstation a PALES simulation typically takes 
less than a second. 



About the Name PALES
====================

Pales is the Roman patron goddess of shepherds and flocks. Pales also 
presides over the health and fertility of the domestic animals. Her 
festival is the Palilia (also called the Parilia) and was celebrated 
by shepherds on April 21, the legendary founding date of Rome. On that 
day large fires were made through which they drove the cattle.

Subsequently, an asteroid (discovered September 19th 1857) and a 
butterfly (Boloria pales) was named after the goddess.



Command Line Arguments
======================

The following command line arguments are available (pales -help):
